      <description>Jo&amp;rsquo;s time in Pennsylvania Jolanda has put another notch in her belt, aka visited yet another, new state. Before you know it, she will have visited more states than Rodney!
She had a great time visiting an area where Amish and Mennonites live. The debriefing retreat for missionaries was held in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, in the pretty town of Ephrata. What a different world than Colorado! The rolling hills reminded her a lot of Germany and Luxembourg.</description>

      <description>Snow Everywhere It&amp;rsquo;s been a snowy January, here in the US and in The Netherlands. It was on a snowy day in January six years ago that we packed our 9 suitcases in a van and headed for the airport for our flight to Colorado. We can hardly believe it ourselves, but January 26th marked our 6 anniversary here in the US. My how the time has flown.
 A couple of weeks ago, during an unexpected snowstorm, Jolanda tried to bring Sarah to school.</description>

      <description>22-year missions adventure This month marks 22 years ago that we went into missions and started our Youth with a Mission adventure.
An incredible missionary adventure with God, an adventure in faith and trust, an adventure across borders, an adventure in being dependent on donations, an adventure in wonderful provision, blessings and testimonies. 22 years of missions made possible, in part, by you!
 First missions trip to Uganda in 1996.</description>

      <description>The last week of April and the first week of May, seven participants came for the &amp;ldquo;Radiant Life&amp;rdquo; Debriefing retreat for missionary families, couples and singles in Orlando. This was a period of rest, refreshment and renewal for these missionaries. Here are just a couple of powerful testimonies from participants in the Radiant Life debriefing retreat in Orlando, Florida:
&amp;ldquo;What a week! Our family spent the last 9 days in Florida attending a missionary debrief conference “Radiant Life” through Excelling Leaders.</description>

      <description>International Member Care Consultation (IMCC) A couple weeks ago Jolanda attended the International Member Care Consultation (IMCC) at YWAM Orlando, FL. Together with YWAM Member Care workers from the Caribbean, East and South East Asia, Europe, North America, South America and Africa they came together to reconnect, receive teaching, and do a lot of networking. It was a great opportunity to learn about the different training models/courses and internships for member care workers.</description>

      <description>Missionary Care Workshop A few weeks ago, Jolanda, as part of the YWAM North American Member Care Network, was asked to give a workshop on missionary care at a YWAM conference here in Colorado Springs.
 For the most part, this conference focused on people who are doing a Discipleship Training School (DTS) at the moment. The conference was attended by about 200 students from different YWAM locations (from various states).</description>

      <description>Ever been awakened in the middle of the night by a bear trying to get into your trash can, but just couldn&amp;rsquo;t get in? This has happened to us a couple of times, but the most recent time, we finally got to see the bear live and in person. Thankfully, we have a chain on our trash can that kept him (her?) out, and once he saw us peeking out of the window at him, he ran away, but not before we got a look at him.</description>
