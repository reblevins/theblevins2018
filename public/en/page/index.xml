      <description>Youth With A Mission (YWAM) affirms the Bible as the authoritative word of God and, with the Holy Spirit’s inspiration, the absolute reference point for every aspect of life and ministry. Based upon God’s word, who He is, and His initiative of salvation, the following responses are strongly emphasized in YWAM:
Worship: We are called to praise and worship God alone
Holiness: We are called to lead holy and righteous lives that exemplify the nature and character of God</description>

      <description>We strongly believe that the truth of the Gospel applied to every area of society – Family, Church, Education, Media, Celebration (art, entertainment, sport) Business (which starts with innovations in science and technology, productivity, sales, and service), and Government is the only way to transform a nation. Only Christian values and principles based on godly truth will be the way to walk into the inheritance that Nations have in the kingdom of God.</description>
