      <description>We, Rodney and Jolanda Blevins, have been missionaries with Youth With A Mission (YWAM) since 1997. Through various missions and ministry trips throughout the years, we have impacted people in 16 different countries spanning five continents!
We both did a Discipleship Training School (DTS) at the YWAM base Heidebeek in Heerde, The Netherlands. The DTS is YWAMâ€™s six month training course designed to help you understand God more deeply, live more like Jesus and identify your unique gifts and purpose to use in missions.</description>
