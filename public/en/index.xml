      <description>22-year missions adventure This month marks 22 years ago that we went into missions and started our Youth with an Mission adventure.
An incredible missionary adventure with God, an adventure in faith and trust, an adventure across borders, an adventure in being dependent on donations, an adventure in wonderful provision, blessings and testimonies. 22 years of missions made possible, in part, by you!
 First missions trip to Uganda in 1996.</description>

      <description>The last week of April and the first week of May, seven participants came for the &amp;ldquo;Radiant Life&amp;rdquo; Debriefing retreat for missionary families, couples and singles in Orlando. This was a period of rest, refreshment and renewal for these missionaries. Here are just a couple of powerful testimonies from participants in the Radiant Life debriefing retreat in Orlando, Florida:
&amp;ldquo;What a week! Our family spent the last 9 days in Florida attending a missionary debrief conference “Radiant Life” through Excelling Leaders.</description>

      <description>We, Rodney and Jolanda Blevins, have been missionaries with Youth With A Mission (YWAM) since 1997. Through various missions and ministry trips throughout the years, we have impacted people in 16 different countries spanning five continents!
We both did a Discipleship Training School (DTS) at the YWAM base Heidebeek in Heerde, The Netherlands. The DTS is YWAM’s six month training course designed to help you understand God more deeply, live more like Jesus and identify your unique gifts and purpose to use in missions.</description>

      <description>International Member Care Consultation (IMCC) A couple weeks ago Jolanda attended the International Member Care Consultation (IMCC) at YWAM Orlando, FL. Together with YWAM Member Care workers from the Caribbean, East and South East Asia, Europe, North America, South America and Africa they came together to reconnect, receive teaching, and do a lot of networking. It was a great opportunity to learn about the different training models/courses and internships for member care workers.</description>

      <description>Missionary Care Workshop A few weeks ago, Jolanda, as part of the YWAM North American Member Care Network, was asked to give a workshop on missionary care at a YWAM conference here in Colorado Springs.
 For the most part, this conference focused on people who are doing a Discipleship Training School (DTS) at the moment. The conference was attended by about 200 students from different YWAM locations (from various states).</description>

      <description>Ever been awakened in the middle of the night by a bear trying to get into your trash can, but just couldn&amp;rsquo;t get in? This has happened to us a couple of times, but the most recent time, we finally got to see the bear live and in person. Thankfully, we have a chain on our trash can that kept him (her?) out, and once he saw us peeking out of the window at him, he ran away, but not before we got a look at him.</description>

      <description>Youth With A Mission (YWAM) affirms the Bible as the authoritative word of God and, with the Holy Spirit’s inspiration, the absolute reference point for every aspect of life and ministry. Based upon God’s word, who He is, and His initiative of salvation, the following responses are strongly emphasized in YWAM:
Worship: We are called to praise and worship God alone
Holiness: We are called to lead holy and righteous lives that exemplify the nature and character of God</description>

      <description>We strongly believe that the truth of the Gospel applied to every area of society – Family, Church, Education, Media, Celebration (art, entertainment, sport) Business (which starts with innovations in science and technology, productivity, sales, and service), and Government is the only way to transform a nation. Only Christian values and principles based on godly truth will be the way to walk into the inheritance that Nations have in the kingdom of God.</description>
